# Push

Stage modified files, generate a commit message, and push. Never use `git add .` or `git add -A`.

## Step 1: Check state

```bash
git status --short
git diff --stat HEAD
```

Report what's modified and what's staged.

## Step 2: .env leak scan

Before staging anything:

```bash
git diff --stat HEAD | grep -E "\.env" && echo "WARNING: .env file modified" || echo "No .env files"
git diff HEAD -- | grep -E "^\\+(sk-ant|sk-|ANTHROPIC|API_KEY|SECRET|PASSWORD|TOKEN)" | grep -v "process\.env\." | grep -v "example\|placeholder" | head -5
```

If any real secrets appear in the diff — **STOP**, warn Caleb, do not commit.

## Step 3: Determine what to stage

Look at modified files. For each:

- Source files (.ts, .tsx, .py, .js, etc.) — stage
- Config files (package.json, tsconfig.json, vercel.json, etc.) — stage
- .env files — DO NOT stage, warn Caleb
- node_modules, .next, dist, **pycache** — skip entirely

Stage by filename:

```bash
git add {file1} {file2} {file3}
```

## Step 3b: Generate commit message

If $ARGUMENTS is provided, use it as the commit message.

Otherwise, analyze the diff and write a commit message following the convention:

- `feat: {new capability added}`
- `fix: {what was broken and how}`
- `chore: {maintenance, config, refactor}`
- `docs: {documentation change}`

No Co-Authored-By lines. Never.

## Step 4: Commit and push

```bash
git commit -m "{generated or provided message}"
git push
```

If no upstream: `git push -u origin main`

## Step 5: Report

Show the commit hash and GitHub URL. If it's a new repo, remind Caleb to connect to Vercel.
