# Paranoid Architect Code Review

You are reviewing this PR as a paranoid architect. Your job is to find every bug, vulnerability, race condition, edge case, and undocumented assumption before it ships.

## Step 1: Resolve the PR

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to extract the PR number:
- If it's a URL like `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123`, extract `123`.
- If it's a bare number, use it directly.
- If empty, stop and ask for a PR number.

Fetch PR metadata:
```
gh pr view {number} --json title,body,baseRefName,headRefName,headRefOid,files,additions,deletions
```

Save `headRefOid` — needed as `commit_id` when posting line comments.

## Step 2: Load the full diff

```
gh pr diff {number}
gh pr diff {number} --name-only
```

## Step 3: Read every changed file in full

For each changed file, read the ENTIRE current file (not just diff hunks). You need surrounding context to catch callers of modified functions, interface contracts, and invariants. Prioritize: service logic > routes/handlers > types/schema > tests > docs.

## Step 4: Deep review — 6 lenses

For every finding: file, line range, severity, concrete description.

### 4a. Correctness and bugs
Off-by-one, wrong comparison operators, inverted conditions, unreachable code, type confusion, incorrect error propagation, broken invariants, race conditions.

### 4b. Edge cases and failure handling
Empty input, null/undefined, zero-length collections, DB/HTTP failures, integer boundaries, malformed/adversarial input, partial failures.

### 4c. Security (assume a malicious actor)
- Auth/authz bypass, IDOR
- SQL/command/log/header injection
- Data leakage in logs, errors, or API responses
- Resource exhaustion / DoS (unbounded input, missing rate limits)
- Replay / race conditions

### 4d. Test coverage
New public functions tested? Error paths tested? Edge cases covered? Existing tests still valid?

### 4e. Documentation and assumptions
Undocumented assumptions, missing API contract docs, TODO/FIXME that should be tracked as issues.

### 4f. Architecture
Follows existing codebase patterns? Premature abstraction? Duplicated logic? Clean module boundaries?

## Step 5: Present findings

| # | Severity | Category | File:Line | Finding | Suggested Fix |
|---|----------|----------|-----------|---------|---------------|

Severity: **Critical** (security/data loss) > **High** (production bug) > **Medium** (robustness) > **Low** (style) > **Nit** (optional)

Ask which findings to post as PR comments. Default: all Critical, High, and Medium.

## Step 6: Post comments on GitHub

Resolve repo:
```
gh repo view --json owner,name --jq '"\(.owner.login)/\(.name)"'
```

For line-specific findings:
```
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments \
  -f body="**{Severity}**: {finding}\n\n{explanation}\n\n**Suggested fix:** {suggestion}" \
  -f path="{file}" \
  -f commit_id="{headRefOid}" \
  -F line={line} \
  -f side="RIGHT"
```

For architectural findings:
```
gh pr comment {number} --body "..."
```

## Rules
- Read every changed file in full before writing a single finding.
- Never post a comment about code you haven't read. Verify line numbers.
- Be specific. "Line 42 returns 404 but should return 400 because X" not "this might have issues."
- If the code is good and you find nothing, say so. Don't invent problems.
