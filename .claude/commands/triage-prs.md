# PR Triage Dashboard

## Step 1: Fetch open PRs

```
gh pr list --state open --limit 100 --json number,title,author,createdAt,updatedAt,labels,reviewDecision,isDraft,additions,deletions,changedFiles,headRefName,baseRefName,mergeable
```

For each PR, fetch its file list to determine module:
```
gh pr view {number} --json files --jq '.files[].path'
```

## Step 2: Classify each PR

**Module** (based on changed file paths):
- `web/ui` — components, pages, styles
- `api` — routes, handlers, middleware
- `db/schema` — migrations, schema, ORM models
- `auth` — authentication, session, OAuth
- `ai/ml` — model integration, prompts, inference
- `infra/ci` — GitHub Actions, Vercel config, Docker
- `tests` — test files only
- `docs` — documentation only
- `deps` — dependency bumps
- `other` — doesn't fit above

**Review state:**
- `approved` — at least one approval, no changes requested
- `changes-requested` — reviewer asked for changes
- `reviewed` — comments but no formal decision
- `automated-only` — only bot reviews (Copilot, Dependabot)
- `no-review` — no reviews at all

**Scope:**
- `tiny` — <50 lines changed
- `small` — 50–200 lines
- `medium` — 200–500 lines
- `large` — 500–2000 lines
- `xl` — 2000+ lines or 15+ files

**Risk type:**
- `fix` — bug fix, safe to merge quickly after review
- `feature` — new capability, standard review
- `architectural` — changes interfaces, DB schema, auth flow — needs deep review

## Step 3: Detect conflicts/overlaps

Identify PRs that touch the same files — flag potential merge conflicts or conceptual overlap.

## Step 4: Output dashboard

```
## Summary
Total open: N | Approved: N | Needs review: N | Stale (>14d): N

## Ready to Merge (approved, CI green, no conflicts)
[table: # | title | author | scope | module | age]

## Fixes Needing Review (risk=fix, no approval)
[table: # | title | author | scope | module | age]

## Features Needing Review
[table: # | title | author | scope | module | age]

## Architectural PRs (need deep review)
[table: # | title | author | scope | module | age | what changes]

## Changes Requested — Awaiting Author
[table: # | title | author | feedback summary | stale?]

## Draft PRs
[table: # | title | author | progress note]

## Stale (>14 days no activity)
[table: # | title | author | last activity]

## Conflicts / Overlaps
[list: PR A + PR B touch same files: [file list]]

## Module Groups
[by module: list of PR numbers + titles]

## Recommendations
[3-5 concrete next actions for the team]
```

## Rules

- Read-only. No comments, approvals, or merges.
- Use only `gh` CLI.
- Do not speculate about code quality without reading the diff.
