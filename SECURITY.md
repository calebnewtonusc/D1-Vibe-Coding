# Security

## Reporting vulnerabilities

If you find a security issue (leaked credentials, injection vulnerability, etc.), open a GitHub issue or email the maintainer directly.

## Known issue: historical token in git history

A Todoist API token was previously committed to command files and has since been removed from all files. However, it remains in git history.

### If you forked before April 2026

The token `f0126e...` in older commits is the maintainer's Todoist token. It has been rotated and is no longer valid. No action needed on your part.

### For the maintainer: cleaning git history

To fully remove the token from history, run BFG Repo Cleaner:

```bash
# Install BFG
brew install bfg

# Clone a bare copy
git clone --mirror https://github.com/calebnewtonusc/D1-Vibe-Coding.git

# Create a file with the secret to remove
echo "f0126e193b7fb233c00d57d8480de4741106209e" > secrets.txt

# Run BFG
bfg --replace-text secrets.txt D1-Vibe-Coding.git

# Clean up and push
cd D1-Vibe-Coding.git
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now --aggressive
git push
```

Then rotate the Todoist token at https://todoist.com/app/settings/integrations/developer.

## Best practices enforced by this repo

- `PreToolUse` hook warns before writing to `.env` files
- `/push` command scans diffs for secret patterns before committing
- `/audit` command greps for hardcoded tokens in source files
- `settings.json` uses env vars (`$TODOIST_API_TOKEN`), never inline tokens
- `.gitignore` template excludes `.env`, `.dev.vars`, and credential files
- CI workflow checks for leaked secret patterns on every push
